# Cottontail

## Tests

**Server tests: **
To run the server tests run the following command from the project root:

	node serverSpec-runner.js

This will run the tests in the ==/spec== folder and generates a JUnitXml report in the ==/spec/report== folder. The tests files must have a ***[sS]pec.js** ending.
